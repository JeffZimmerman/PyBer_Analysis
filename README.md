# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to resample data on ride-sharing services to better focus specifically on differences between types of cities, defined as Urban, Suburban, and Rural. New dataframes were created using Matplotlib functionality to merge csv files, reorganize, resort, and relabel the data into a more ideal form. The specific application was identified as creating effective visualization of the data for presentation to the CEO of a ride-sharing company, herself well-versed in data analytics and data visualization.

## Results
Based on the task of comparing data from different city types over time, a multiple-line chart was deemed the best method for communicating these differences. Daily data was aggregated into weekly intervals, and multiple cities consolidated based on their geographical type, which downplayed individual variations among a single type while highlighting the contrasts across these types. While ride-sharing services in all three city types showed variation in the fares collected based on date, each stayed within a distinct range throughout the year.
